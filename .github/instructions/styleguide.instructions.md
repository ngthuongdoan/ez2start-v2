# Mantine Application Style Guide: Principles and Practices

## Introduction

This document serves as a foundational resource for developers and designers working with Mantine, ensuring a consistent, accessible, and high-quality user experience across the application. It outlines the principles and practical guidelines for leveraging Mantine's robust theming system and component library.

Mantine offers a comprehensive suite of components and hooks designed for rapid development of accessible web applications.[1, 2] Its strength lies in its highly customizable theme object, which centralizes design tokens, allowing for a unified visual language and efficient global style management.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] This guide will detail how to harness these capabilities to build a cohesive and user-friendly interface.

## I. Mantine Theming: Establishing Your Design Foundation

Mantine's theming system is the cornerstone of a consistent application design. By defining design tokens globally, developers can ensure a unified look and feel across all components and rapidly adapt the application's aesthetic.

### A. The Mantine Theme Object: Your Centralized Design Token Repository

The `MantineTheme` object acts as a single source of truth for an application's design tokens.[3, 4, 5, 6] This comprehensive object encompasses various styling aspects, including `colors`, which define named color palettes, each with 10 shades.[3, 9, 10, 11] The `primaryColor` and `primaryShade` properties are crucial for setting the application's default accent color and its specific shade for components, influencing the visual prominence of interactive elements.[3, 9, 10, 11]

Typography is controlled through `fontFamily`, `fontFamilyMonospace`, and `headings`, which dictate font families for general text, monospace code blocks, and various heading levels, respectively.[3, 6, 9, 12, 13] A defined scale for text sizes and line heights is managed by `fontSizes` and `lineHeights`.[3, 5, 6, 12, 13] For consistent spacing, the `spacing` property standardizes padding and margin values across components.[3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15] Visual consistency is further maintained by `radius` for border-radius values and `shadows` for predefined box-shadow effects.[3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15]

Responsive design is supported by `breakpoints`, which configure the points at which layout changes occur.[3, 5, 6, 16] The `colorScheme` property determines whether the application renders in `light` or `dark` mode, a fundamental aspect of modern UI design.[4, 6, 17] Critical for usability, `focusRing` and `focusRingStyles` control the visual feedback for keyboard focus, directly impacting accessibility for users who navigate without a mouse.[3, 4, 5] Other global styling properties like `defaultRadius`, `defaultGradient`, `cursorType`, `autoContrast`, and `luminanceThreshold` provide additional control over the application's appearance and behavior.[3, 4] Finally, the `components` property enables deep customization of individual Mantine components, allowing for overrides of default props or styles.[3]

#### Global Theme Configuration with `MantineProvider`

The `MantineProvider` component is essential for applying a custom theme globally.[6, 7, 8, 17] It is a best practice to render this component once at the root of the application. Developers pass their theme override object to the `theme` prop, which is then deeply merged with Mantine's `DEFAULT_THEME`.[4, 6, 17, 18] This merging mechanism ensures that any theme properties not explicitly overridden will gracefully fall back to Mantine's sensible defaults, providing a robust and flexible styling foundation.jsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const myTheme = createTheme({
fontFamily: 'Open Sans, sans-serif',
primaryColor: 'cyan',
//... other theme overrides
});

function App() {
return (
\<MantineProvider theme={myTheme}\>
{/\* Your application components \*/}
\</MantineProvider\>
);
}

````

#### Implementing Light and Dark Color Schemes

Mantine components inherently support both light and dark color schemes.[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10] The `colorScheme` property within the theme object, or the `defaultColorScheme` prop on `MantineProvider`, dictates the active scheme.[4, 17] To ensure user preferences are maintained across sessions, Mantine provides a `colorSchemeManager` prop for `MantineProvider`, commonly configured to persist the selected scheme using `localStorage`.[17] This allows for a seamless and personalized user experience.

```jsx
import { MantineProvider, localStorageColorSchemeManager } from '@mantine/core';

const colorSchemeManager = localStorageColorSchemeManager({ key: 'my-app-color-scheme' });

function App() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider colorSchemeManager={colorSchemeManager} defaultColorScheme="auto">
      {/* Your application components */}
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}
````

The approach of centralizing design tokens within the Mantine theme object and applying them globally via `MantineProvider` offers significant advantages for scalability and maintainability. When a brand color needs to be updated, for instance, the change is applied in a single location within the theme object. This eliminates the need to search and replace color values across numerous component files or isolated CSS declarations. This centralized control directly impacts the ease with which design changes can be scaled across the application and improves the overall maintainability of the codebase. Such a strategy significantly reduces technical debt over the long term and accelerates design iterations, making the application more adaptable to evolving brand guidelines or user preferences, which is a critical factor for the sustained health of any project.

#### Table 1: Mantine Theme Object Core Properties

| Name | Description | Type | Default Value (Example) |

### B. Customizing Design Tokens for Brand Consistency

#### Colors

Mantine's default theme uses Open Color, providing 10 shades for each color.[9, 10, 11] When introducing custom colors to `theme.colors`, it is essential to supply an array containing at least 10 shades, indexed from 0 (lightest) to 9 (darkest), with higher indices representing darker shades.[10, 11] Failure to adhere to this requirement can lead to TypeScript errors and incorrect rendering of certain component variants.[10, 11, 19] Tools such as Mantine's color generator or Material Design Colors are valuable resources for generating these comprehensive palettes.[11, 19] Supported color formats include HEX, RGB, HSL, and OKLCH, offering flexibility in color definition.[10, 19]

```jsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    'my-brand-blue':,
  },
});
```

The `primaryColor` property, which defaults to `blue`, dictates the accent color used by components when no specific `color` prop is provided.[3, 9, 11] Complementing this, `primaryShade`, defaulting to `{ light: 6, dark: 8 }`, specifies which shade of the `primaryColor` is applied to components.[3, 9, 10, 11] This dual control allows for precise tuning of the visual intensity of primary interactive elements across both light and dark color schemes. The default values for `primaryShade` (a mid-to-darker shade for light mode and a lighter shade for dark mode) are not arbitrary; they reflect common design patterns aimed at ensuring visual prominence and adequate color contrast. It is noteworthy that Mantine may, in some cases, override the specified `primaryShade` if it detects potential contrast issues, demonstrating the library's built-in considerations for visual accessibility. Understanding how `primaryShade` functions is therefore crucial for maintaining both visual hierarchy and the perceivability of content, especially concerning color contrast, across different color schemes.

For advanced customization of how colors are applied to component variants, such as `Button` or `ActionIcon`, the `variantColorResolver` can be defined within the theme.[3, 20] This function provides a powerful mechanism to override default color logic or to integrate support for entirely new component variants, offering deep control over the application's visual presentation.

#### Typography

The application's typography can be meticulously defined by setting the global `fontFamily` for most components, `fontFamilyMonospace` for code blocks, and `headings.fontFamily` for heading elements.[3, 6, 9, 12] This capability is fundamental for establishing and maintaining brand typography throughout the application.

```jsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif',
  fontFamilyMonospace: 'Fira Code, monospace',
  headings: { fontFamily: 'Montserrat, sans-serif' },
});
```

Mantine provides a default set of `fontSizes` (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) and `lineHeights`.[5, 12, 13] These predefined values can be extended or completely overridden within the theme object, which subsequently generates corresponding CSS variables (e.g., `--mantine-font-size-xs`).[12, 13] This mechanism ensures that the application's typographic scale is consistent and easily manageable.

```jsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  fontSizes: {
    xs: '0.625rem', // 10px
    sm: '0.75rem',  // 12px
    //... other default sizes
    customLarge: '1.5rem', // 24px
  },
  lineHeights: {
    md: 1.6, // Override default md line height
  },
});
```

The `headings` object within the theme allows for granular control over `h1` through `h6` elements, including their `fontSize`, `lineHeight`, and `fontWeight`.[3, 12, 13, 21] Additionally, a global `textWrap` property can be configured for all headings, influencing how text breaks within these elements.[21] The ability to customize font families, sizes, and weights for both general text and specific headings extends beyond mere aesthetics; it directly influences the visual hierarchy and readability of content. A well-defined typographic scale guides the user's eye, emphasizes important information, and ensures comfortable reading experiences. The `textWrap` property further supports readability by controlling how long lines of text break, preventing awkward orphans or excessively long lines, which is particularly important for responsive layouts. Therefore, typography customization in Mantine is not merely about branding; it is a critical tool for establishing clear information hierarchy and enhancing content readability, contributing to a more perceivable and understandable user interface.

| `--mantine-h3-line-height` | `1.4` | H3 line height |
| `--mantine-h4-font-size` | `1.125rem (18px)` | H4 font size |
| `--mantine-h4-line-height` | `1.45` | H4 line height |
| `--mantine-h5-font-size` | `1rem (16px)` | H5 font size |
| `--mantine-h5-line-height` | `1.5` | H5 line height |
| `--mantine-h6-font-size` | `0.875rem (14px)` | H6 font size |
| `--mantine-h6-line-height` | `1.5` | H6 line height |

#### Layout & Visuals

The `spacing` object within the theme defines a standardized scale for margins and padding, with values such as `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`.[3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15] These values are consistently referenced by component props like `m`, `p`, and `gap`.[8, 14, 15] This consistency is paramount for maintaining visual rhythm throughout the application and preventing minor "pixel-perfect" inconsistencies that can detract from a polished user interface.

Similarly, the `radius` object defines a set of border-radius values (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).[3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 15] The `defaultRadius` property then applies one of these predefined values (e.g., `'md'`) to most Mantine components by default.[3, 4, 5] This ensures a consistent level of "softness" or "sharpness" across all UI elements, contributing to a unified visual style.

For visual depth and hierarchy, the `shadows` object provides predefined box-shadow values (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).[3, 6, 12, 13, 15] Consistent application of these shadows helps to visually separate elements and guide the user's attention.

Further global styling properties include `defaultGradient`, which sets a default gradient for components that support the `variant="gradient"`.[3, 4] The `focusRing` property controls the visual style of the focus ring (`auto`, `always`, `never`), with `auto` being the default and highly recommended for accessibility, as it displays the focus ring only when a user navigates with a keyboard.[3, 4, 5] More granular customization of these styles is possible through `focusRingStyles`.[4] Lastly, `cursorType` determines whether interactive elements display a `default` or `pointer` cursor, contributing to intuitive user interaction.[3, 4]

The global configuration of properties such as `defaultRadius`, `defaultGradient`, `focusRing`, and `cursorType` may seem minor individually, but their collective impact on user experience is substantial. `defaultRadius` ensures visual harmony across components. `defaultGradient` standardizes a visual flourish. Most importantly, `focusRing` and `cursorType` directly affect usability and accessibility. Setting `focusRing` to `'auto'` is a recognized best practice, as it displays the focus ring only when a user navigates with a keyboard. This approach is less intrusive for mouse users while still providing critical visual feedback for keyboard users, which aligns with the "Operable" principle of web content accessibility, specifically Guideline 2.4 on Navigable content. Configuring these global defaults ensures a cohesive and accessible user experience without necessitating individual component-level overrides, reinforcing the benefits of a centralized theme for efficient and consistent design application.

#### Table 3: Mantine Spacing, Radius, and Shadow CSS Variables [12, 13]

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| `--mantine-shadow-md` | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0 20px 25px -5px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0 10px 10px -5px` | Medium shadow |
| `--mantine-shadow-lg` | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0 28px 23px -7px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0 12px 12px -7px` | Large shadow |
| `--mantine-shadow-xl` | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), rgba(0,0,0,0.05) 0 36px 28px -7px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0 17px 17px -7px` | Extra large shadow |

## II. Responsive Design with Mantine: Adapting to Any Screen

Responsive design is critical for modern web applications, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. Mantine provides robust tools for implementing adaptive layouts.

### A. Understanding Mantine's Breakpoint System

Mantine's responsive components are built upon a predefined set of breakpoints. While earlier versions of Mantine may have utilized `px` units for breakpoints [22, 23], current versions typically employ `em` units.[16, 24] The default `em` values are `xs: 36em`, `sm: 48em`, `md: 62em`, `lg: 75em`, and `xl: 88em`.[12, 24] The use of `em` units is generally recommended for media queries because they are relative to the user's font size, which enhances the accessibility of the design and its responsiveness to different browser zoom levels.[16]

These default breakpoint values are fully customizable and can be overridden within the `theme.breakpoints` object, which is passed to the `MantineProvider`.[16, 22, 23, 24] This flexibility allows the application's responsive behavior to be precisely aligned with specific design requirements and target device characteristics.

```jsx
import { createTheme, MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  breakpoints: {
    xs: '30em', // 480px
    sm: '48em', // 768px
    md: '64em', // 1024px
    lg: '74em', // 1184px
    xl: '90em', // 1440px
  },
});
```

The evolution in Mantine's breakpoint units, from `px` to `em`, reflects a deliberate choice with implications for accessibility. The preference for `em` is rooted in its ability to scale relative to the user's font size, making designs more adaptable to various viewing conditions and user preferences, which directly supports the "Perceivable" principle of web content accessibility, specifically Guideline 1.4 on Resizable Text. However, it is important to note a nuanced consideration: the documentation indicates that CSS variables, which Mantine heavily relies upon, may not function as expected within container queries if `rem` scaling is a dependency.[16] This suggests a potential trade-off where, for certain advanced responsive patterns like container queries, using `px` might be more straightforward if `rem` scaling introduces complexities. Therefore, a careful decision is needed based on the specific application's requirements and the desired balance between global font-size scalability and component-level container query flexibility.

#### Table 4: Mantine Default Breakpoints [12]

| Breakpoint | Default `em` Value | Equivalent `px` Value (assuming 1em = 16px) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `xs` | `36em` | `576px` |
| `sm` | `48em` | `768px` |
| `md` | `62em` | `992px` |
| `lg` | `75em` | `1200px` |
| `xl` | `88em` | `1408px` |

### B. Applying Responsive Styles Effectively

Many Mantine components and style props, such as `w` (width), `h` (height), `m` (margin), `p` (padding), `gap` (spacing), `cols` (columns), and `span` (column span), support an object notation for responsive values.[14, 16, 25, 26, 27] This powerful feature allows developers to define different values for various breakpoints, including `base` (the default value for all screen sizes), `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. The appropriate value is then automatically applied based on the current viewport width. For example, a `Box` component's width can be set to `w={{ base: 320, sm: 480, lg: 640 }}` to adapt its size across different screen dimensions.[14, 16]

For conditional rendering based on screen size, all Mantine components that possess a root element support the `hiddenFrom` and `visibleFrom` props.[16] These props accept a breakpoint name (e.g., `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) and control the visibility of the component by hiding or showing it depending on whether the viewport width is less than or greater than the specified breakpoint.[16] These functionalities rely on global classes that are injected by the `MantineProvider`.[17] An example would be `<Button hiddenFrom="sm">Hidden from sm</Button>`, which ensures the button is not displayed on small screens and above.[16]

For more intricate responsive styles that are not directly covered by component props, `createStyles` is the recommended and most performant approach.[8, 22, 23, 24, 28] This function allows for the embedding of media queries directly within the style definitions, leveraging theme breakpoints for dynamic styling.

```jsx
const useStyles = createStyles((theme) => ({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: theme.colors.blue,
    [`@media (max-width: ${theme.breakpoints.xl}px)`]: {
      backgroundColor: theme.colors.pink,
    },
  },
}));
```

Additionally, all Mantine components support the `sx` prop for adding inline styles, including responsive styles.[22, 23, 24] While convenient for small, isolated overrides, excessive use of the `sx` prop can negatively impact performance compared to CSS modules, as it generates inline styles that are not reused.[28]

Mantine's `Grid` and `SimpleGrid` components offer a powerful feature for component-level responsiveness through `type="container"`.[25, 26, 27] This enables their columns and spacing to adjust based on the *container's* width, rather than the global viewport width.[25, 26, 27] When utilizing container queries, it is important to note that breakpoints must be defined using exact `px` or `em` values, rather than referencing theme breakpoint keys.[16, 25, 27] The implementation of `type="container"` represents a significant advancement over traditional media queries. While media queries are global and affect the entire viewport, container queries allow components to be self-responsive based on their parent's size. This means a component can adapt its layout independently of its position within the application, fostering greater reusability and encapsulation. This approach simplifies the management of complex global media queries for individual component behavior. Prioritizing container queries for layout-heavy components like `Grid` and `SimpleGrid` therefore enhances component reusability and streamlines responsive logic, resulting in a more robust and manageable design system. This is considered a best practice for building truly modular and adaptive UI elements.

## III. Mantine Component Usage Guidelines: Building Consistent UI Elements

Mantine provides a rich set of components, all designed to be highly customizable and consistent. Understanding their shared properties and specific behaviors is key to building a cohesive user interface.

### A. General Component Properties and Their Application

Many Mantine components share common props for styling, which facilitates the consistent application of design tokens across the application.[8, 15] These shared properties include `color`, which references values from `theme.colors`.[8, 15] This prop can accept a color name (e.g., `teal`), a color name combined with a shade index (e.g., `blue.3`), or a direct CSS color value (e.g., `#1D72FE`).[8, 10, 15]

The `size` prop controls various CSS properties such as height, padding, and font-size, using predefined values (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) or specific pixel values.[8, 15] Similarly, `radius` sets border-radius, referencing values from `theme.radius` or accepting direct pixel values.[8, 15] `shadow` applies box-shadows, drawing from `theme.shadows` or allowing custom CSS shadow strings.[8, 15]

For consistent internal and external spacing, `spacing` and `padding` props are used, referencing `theme.spacing` values or specific pixel values.[8, 14, 15] Mantine also provides shorthand props like `m` (margin), `p` (padding), `mx` (horizontal margin), and `py` (vertical padding) for convenience.[8, 14]

The consistent application of shared style properties like `color`, `size`, `radius`, `shadow`, `spacing`, and `padding` across numerous Mantine components is a fundamental aspect of its design system. This consistency is not merely a convenience; it serves as a direct implementation of design token usage. By consistently mapping these properties to theme values, Mantine ensures that a `size="md"` button, for example, maintains a proportional visual relationship with a `size="md"` input. Similarly, a `radius="sm"` card will exhibit the same corner roundness as a `radius="sm"` button. This approach significantly reduces visual inconsistencies throughout the application and minimizes the need for component-specific style overrides, thereby streamlining development and enhancing the overall user experience. Leveraging Mantine's shared properties and their direct connection to the theme object is a primary best practice for achieving a highly consistent and predictable user interface, which contributes to the "Understandable" principle of web content accessibility by providing a familiar and predictable interface for users.

### B. Core UI Components: Detailed Usage and Best Practices

#### 1\. Buttons

Mantine Buttons offer a diverse range of visual `variants`, including `filled`, `light`, `outline`, `subtle`, `transparent`, and `white`, allowing for varied emphasis and visual hierarchy.[20] The `gradient` variant provides a visually distinct option, supporting linear gradients defined by `from`, `to`, and `deg` properties, or it can default to `theme.defaultGradient` if not explicitly set.[4, 20] For brand-specific aesthetics, custom variants can be introduced and their colors resolved through the `variantColorResolver` function within the theme.[20]

Button components also manage various `states`:

  * **Disabled:** The `disabled` prop renders a button as non-interactive and applies visually muted styles.[20] For interactive elements that should *appear* disabled (e.g., links, or buttons with an associated `Tooltip`), the `data-disabled` prop should be used instead. When `data-disabled` is applied, it is crucial to also prevent the default `onClick` behavior to maintain interactive control.[20] Custom disabled styles can be achieved by targeting both `&:disabled` and `&[data-disabled]` CSS selectors.[20]
  * **Loading:** Setting the `loading` prop disables the button and displays a `Loader` component with an overlay, indicating an ongoing process.[20] The appearance of this loader can be further customized using the `loaderProps` prop.[20]

For enhanced visual communication, `leftSection` and `rightSection` props allow for the embedding of icons or other elements within the button, which automatically adjusts padding on the corresponding side.[20] The `justify` prop provides control over the alignment of these sections within the button.[20] Additionally, Buttons support `compact-xs` to `compact-xl` sizes, which maintain the same font-size as their regular counterparts but feature reduced padding and height, ideal for space-constrained interfaces.[20] The `Button` component is polymorphic, meaning its underlying HTML element can be changed via the `component` prop, allowing it to render as an `<a>` tag or other custom components.[20]

For interactive components such as Buttons, accessibility is not solely determined by the component's default behavior but also by careful implementation of its states and iconography. The explicit guidance to use `data-disabled` for links and tooltips instead of the `disabled` attribute directly addresses a critical accessibility concern: truly `disabled` elements are removed from the tab order and are not announced by screen readers, rendering associated tooltips inaccessible. By using `data-disabled`, visual styling can be applied while retaining the semantic meaning and interactive capability for assistive technologies, aligning with the "Operable" principle of web content accessibility, specifically Guideline 2.1 on Keyboard Accessibility. Similarly, general accessibility recommendations emphasize the importance of providing an `aria-label` for icon-only interactive components. While not exclusive to the `Button` component, the use of `leftSection` or `rightSection` for icons makes this a relevant consideration. Therefore, for effective accessibility, developers must ensure that icon-only elements have appropriate `aria-label` attributes to be perceivable by screen readers.

#### Table 5: Mantine Button Variants and States Summary [20]

| Category | Variant/State | Description | Key Props | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **States** | `disabled` | Non-interactive, visually muted. | `disabled` | Unavailable actions |
| | `data-disabled` | Visually muted but interactive (for links/tooltips). | `data-disabled` | Disabled links with tooltips |
| | `loading` | Displays a loader, disabled. | `loading`, `loaderProps` | Submitting forms, fetching data |
| | `compact` | Reduced padding/height, same font size. | `size="compact-md"` | Space-constrained interfaces |

#### 2\. Inputs

The base `Input` component in Mantine serves primarily as a foundational element for constructing custom input fields, providing shared styles and features.[29, 30] For most standard form fields, it is recommended to utilize specialized input components such as `TextInput`, `NativeSelect`, or `Textarea`, as these are designed to be accessible by default and internally incorporate `Input.Wrapper`.[30]

The `Input.Wrapper` component is crucial for providing common input features like `label`, `description`, and `error` messages.[30] Its direct use is advised only when developing custom input components that require these shared functionalities.[30]

Mantine inputs, including the base `Input` and its specialized derivatives, support `default`, `filled`, and `unstyled` visual `variants`.[29, 30] For enhanced user experience, `leftSection` and `rightSection` props allow for the inclusion of icons (e.g., from Tabler Icons, React Icons) or other interactive elements such as keyboard shortcuts, clear buttons, or password toggles.[29, 30] The `rightSectionWidth` and `leftSectionWidth` props provide control over the dimensions of these sections.[29, 30]

Regarding accessibility, it is paramount for `Input` components used without a visible `label` prop to include an `aria-label` attribute. This is critical for screen reader users, as it provides the necessary context for the input field.[29, 30, 31] When `Input.Wrapper` is employed, both the wrapper and the input element must have a unique `id` to ensure proper association, which can often be generated using Mantine's `useId` hook.[30] The `required` and `withAsterisk` props visually indicate mandatory fields; however, only the `required` prop adds the semantic HTML `required` attribute, which is important for form validation and accessibility tools.[30]

The distinction between `Input` and `TextInput` and the explicit advice regarding `aria-label` for unlabeled inputs directly addresses web content accessibility guidelines related to "Name, Role, Value" and "Input Assistance." By default, utilizing `TextInput` components leverages Mantine's built-in accessibility features. For custom inputs, manually ensuring a proper `aria-label` or correctly linking labels with `id` attributes via `Input.Wrapper` is paramount. This emphasizes that while Mantine provides accessible building blocks, developers must actively adhere to best practices in their implementation to ensure full accessibility. Therefore, always prioritize semantic HTML elements, such as `TextInput` over a raw `Input` where appropriate, and explicitly provide `aria-label` or properly link labels and descriptions to inputs, especially for custom components, to ensure they are understandable and operable by assistive technologies.

#### Table 6: Mantine Input Component Key Properties for Customization [29, 30]

| Property | Description | Relevant Snippets | Accessibility Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `label` | Visible label for the input. | [30] | Essential for screen reader association, provides context. |
| `description` | Additional helpful text below the label. | [30] | Provides extra guidance, improves understandability. |
| `error` | Boolean or ReactNode for error state/message. | [30] | Visually indicates error, provides textual error message for all users. |
| `leftSection` | Content (e.g., icon) on the left side. | [29, 30] | Visual cue, but requires `aria-label` if icon-only and interactive. |
| `rightSection` | Content (e.g., icon, button) on the right side. | [29, 30] | Visual cue, but requires `aria-label` if icon-only and interactive. |
| `rightSectionWidth` | Controls width of right section. | [29, 30] | Visual layout control. |
| `rightSectionPointerEvents` | Controls pointer events on right section. | [29, 30] | Allows clicks to pass through non-interactive elements. |
| `required` | Adds asterisk and HTML `required` attribute. | [30] | Visual cue and semantic HTML for required fields. |
| `withAsterisk` | Only adds visual asterisk, no HTML `required`. | [30] | Visual cue for required fields without affecting HTML validity. |
| `aria-label` | Text alternative for screen readers. | [29, 30, 31] | Crucial for inputs without visible labels. |
| `component` | Changes the root HTML element. | [29, 30] | Allows using input as button, select, or with mask libraries. |

#### 3\. Cards

The `Card` component in Mantine serves as a versatile wrapper around the `Paper` component, designed to contain various types of content. It commonly uses `shadow`, `padding`, `radius`, and `withBorder` props to customize its appearance.[32, 33, 34] A key feature is `Card.Section`, a specialized child component that intelligently adjusts its margins to effectively remove the parent `Card`'s padding, allowing content within the section to stretch edge-to-edge.[32, 33, 34, 35] The specific margin behavior of `Card.Section` is dynamic, adapting based on its position within the `Card` (i.e., whether it is the first, last, or a middle child).[32, 33, 34, 35] It is important to note that `Card` relies on direct children mapping, meaning `Card.Section` components should not be wrapped within fragments or other intermediate elements to ensure correct styling.[32, 33, 34, 35]

Both `Card` and `Card.Section` are polymorphic components, which means their underlying HTML element can be altered using the `component` prop. This flexibility allows a `Card` to function as an `<a>` tag, making the entire card clickable, or to render as another custom component.[32, 33, 34] Additional styling control is provided by the `withBorder` prop, which adds contextual top and bottom borders to `Card.Section` based on its position, and the `inheritPadding` prop, which applies the parent `Card`'s horizontal padding to the section.[33, 34, 35]

While Mantine's `Card` component offers substantial structural flexibility, the design of cards, particularly those with multiple interactive elements or complex reading orders, presents potential accessibility challenges. If an entire card is made into a link, it cannot semantically contain other interactive links or buttons within it.[36] Furthermore, visually reordering content using CSS (as `Card.Section` might imply for margins, or `Grid` components with `order` or `offset`) without also changing the underlying HTML source order can disrupt the logical flow for screen readers and keyboard navigation, leading to a "keyboard navigation disconnect".[37] The recommendation to ensure visual order aligns with hierarchical meaning [36] and to thoroughly test keyboard tab order [37] is critical in this context. Therefore, when designing Mantine Cards, especially those with nested interactive elements or complex layouts, it is essential to prioritize a logical source order that corresponds with the visual flow for both keyboard and screen reader users, aligning with the "Operable" principle (Guideline 2.4 Navigable) and "Understandable" principle (Guideline 3.2 Predictable) of web content accessibility. It is also important to avoid making the entire card a single link if it contains other actionable elements and to ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements within the card.[36]

#### 4\. Text & Titles

The `Text` component provides granular control over various typographic styles. Its `size` prop allows setting font size using Mantine's theme scale (`xs`-`xl`) or specific pixel values.[38, 39, 40] Font weight is controlled by `fw` (or `weight`), accepting values like `500` for semibold or `700` for bold.[38, 39, 40] Font style can be set to `italic` via the `fs` prop, and text decoration, such as `underline` or `line-through`, is managed by `td`.[38, 39, 40] The `c` (or `color`) prop sets the text color, supporting theme colors (e.g., `blue`), a `dimmed` state, or direct CSS color values.[38, 39, 40] Text transformation (e.g., `uppercase`, `capitalize`) is handled by `tt`, and text alignment by `ta`.[38, 39, 40]

For visual flair, `Text` supports a `gradient` variant, enabling linear text gradients defined by `from`, `to`, and `deg` properties.[38, 39] To manage content overflow, the `lineClamp` prop truncates text after a specified number of lines, while `truncate` adds `text-overflow: ellipsis` styles.[21, 38, 39] The `inherit` prop allows `Text` to adopt parent font-size, font-family, and line-height styles, which is particularly useful for highlighting portions of a `Title` component.[38, 39]

The `Title` component is specifically designed to render `h1`-`h6` headings with Mantine theme styles.[21, 40] Its `order` prop controls the semantic HTML heading tag (e.g., `order={1}` for `<h1>`).[21, 40] `Title` inherits all styling props available to the `Text` component.[21, 40] Critically, its `size` prop can override the default heading font size independently of its `order`, allowing for visual flexibility without compromising semantic structure.[21, 40] `textWrap` and `lineClamp` are also supported for `Title` components.[21]

The `Title` component's `order` prop is directly tied to semantic HTML, which is a foundational practice for web accessibility. Screen readers rely on heading structures (`h1`-`h6`) to allow users to navigate pages efficiently. The ability to control the visual `size` of a title independently of its semantic `order` means that developers can style headings to match design specifications without undermining their structural meaning, which is a common pitfall in web development. This aligns with the "Perceivable" principle (Guideline 1.3 Adaptable) and "Understandable" principle (Guideline 3.2 Predictable) of web content accessibility. Furthermore, the `lineClamp` and `textWrap` properties contribute to readability by preventing text overflow issues that can hinder comprehension. Therefore, it is a best practice to always use `Title` with the correct `order` prop to establish a logical heading hierarchy for screen readers. Developers should leverage its styling properties for visual presentation, ensuring that design choices do not compromise semantic structure, and use text wrapping or clamping to maintain readability across various screen sizes.

#### Table 7: Mantine Text and Title Styling Props [21, 38, 39, 40]

| Property | Description | Component(s) | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `size` | Font size (theme scale or px). | `Text`, `Title` | `xs`, `md`, `xl`, `16px`, `h1` |
| `fw` (`weight`) | Font weight. | `Text`, `Title` | `500`, `700`, `bold` |
| `fs` | Font style. | `Text` | `italic` |
| `td` | Text decoration. | `Text` | `underline`, `line-through` |
| `c` (`color`) | Text color (theme colors or CSS value). | `Text`, `Title` | `blue`, `dimmed`, `#FF0000` |
| `tt` | Text transform. | `Text`, `Title` | `uppercase`, `capitalize` |
| `ta` | Text alignment. | `Text`, `Title` | `center`, `right` |
| `variant` | Predefined text styles or `gradient`. | `Text`, `Title` | `link`, `gradient` |
| `gradient` | Gradient configuration for `gradient` variant. | `Text`, `Title` | `{ from: 'indigo', to: 'cyan', deg: 45 }` |
| `lineClamp` | Truncate text after N lines. | `Text`, `Title` | `3`, `4` |
| `truncate` | Adds `text-overflow: ellipsis`. | `Text` | `end`, `start` |
| `inherit` | Inherit parent font styles. | `Text` | `true` |
| `order` | Semantic HTML heading tag (1-6). | `Title` | `1`, `3`, `6` |
| `textWrap` | Controls text wrapping behavior. | `Title` | `wrap`, `balance` |
| `component` | Changes root HTML element. | `Text`, `Title` | `span`, `a`, `div` |
| `span` | Shorthand for `component="span"`. | `Text` | `true` |

### C. Layout Components: Orchestrating Your UI

#### 1\. Grid & SimpleGrid

Mantine provides two primary grid systems for arranging content: `Grid` and `SimpleGrid`. The `Grid` component is a 12-column flexbox-based system, offering fine-grained control over column layout.[26, 41] Its `span` prop determines column width (from 1 to 12) and supports responsive object notation to adapt column sizes based on viewport width.[26, 41] The `gutter` prop sets spacing between columns, accepting theme spacing values or pixel values.[26, 41] `grow` forces columns in the last row to expand to 100% width, filling available space.[26, 41] `offset` creates gaps by adding left margins to columns.[26, 41] Flexbox properties like `justify` and `align` control content alignment within the grid.[26, 41] The default 12-column layout can be altered using the `columns` prop.[26, 41] A notable feature is `type="container"`, which enables container queries, allowing responsive behavior to be based on the container's width rather than the viewport.[26, 41] When using container queries, breakpoints must be specified with exact `px` or `em` values, not theme breakpoint keys.[26, 41]

In contrast, `SimpleGrid` is a responsive CSS Grid layout where each item occupies an equal amount of space.[25, 27, 42] Unlike `Grid`, `SimpleGrid` does not use individual `span` props; instead, developers specify the number of `cols` per row.[25, 42] Its `cols`, `spacing`, and `verticalSpacing` props all support responsive object notation (`base`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) for adaptive layouts.[25, 27] Similar to `Grid`, `SimpleGrid` also supports `type="container"` for container-based responsiveness, with the same breakpoint value requirements.[25, 27]

The documentation explicitly warns about the dangers of visually reordering content with CSS Grid (which `SimpleGrid` uses and `Grid` can imply with `order` or `offset`) without simultaneously modifying the underlying HTML source order.[37] This is a critical accessibility concern because screen readers and keyboard navigation follow the document's source order, potentially leading to a "keyboard navigation disconnect" where the visual flow does not match the logical flow.[37] The recommended approach is to "start with a structured and accessible document" and to "go back to your source and update it to maintain logical order".[37] Therefore, while Mantine's Grid components provide powerful visual layout capabilities, it is imperative to ensure that the visual order of elements aligns with their logical order in the HTML source. Thoroughly testing keyboard navigation (e.g., using the `tab` key) is essential to prevent users from experiencing disorienting jumps across the document, which aligns with the "Operable" principle (Guideline 2.4 Navigable) and "Understandable" principle (Guideline 3.2 Predictable) of web content accessibility.

#### 2\. Stack, Group, and Flex

Mantine provides specialized flex containers—`Stack`, `Group`, and `Flex`—for common layout patterns.[43] `Stack` is a vertical flex container, ideal for arranging elements in a column, such as lists or content blocks.[43] It utilizes `flexbox gap` for spacing between children.[43] `Group` is a horizontal flex container, best suited for arranging elements in a row, such as buttons or tags. It supports `grow` and `preventGrowOverflow` properties for controlling how children fill available space.[43] `Flex` offers the most comprehensive control over flex container properties, including `direction`, `wrap`, `align`, `justify`, `gap`, `rowGap`, and `columnGap`, and supports responsive props for adapting layouts based on screen size.[43] It is recommended when `Stack` or `Group` prove too restrictive for specific layout needs, and it is also a polymorphic component.[43] All three components support the `gap` prop for consistent spacing between children and `align`/`justify` for content alignment.[43] The `Flex` component explicitly supports responsive props for properties like `direction`, `gap`, and `justify`.[43]

Mantine offers `Stack`, `Group`, and `Flex` components, all leveraging Flexbox for layout. While `Flex` provides maximum control over flex container properties, `Stack` and `Group` are specialized for common vertical and horizontal layouts, respectively. When possible, choosing the most specific component (`Stack` for vertical arrangements, `Group` for horizontal) can lead to cleaner, more readable code and potentially better performance due to less explicit prop configuration. This approach also implicitly guides developers toward common, predictable layout patterns, which significantly aids in code maintainability and reduces cognitive load for the development team. Therefore, it is a best practice to prioritize `Stack` and `Group` for straightforward vertical and horizontal layouts. `Flex` should be reserved for more complex or highly dynamic flexbox scenarios that require fine-grained control or responsive changes to `flexDirection`.

#### Table 8: Responsive Props for Grid and SimpleGrid [8, 16, 20, 25, 26, 27, 41, 43]

| Component | Prop | Description | Responsive Values Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Grid.Col` | `span` | Column width (1-12) relative to parent Grid. | `span={{ base: 12, md: 6, lg: 3 }}` |
| `Grid` | `gutter` | Spacing between columns. | `gutter={{ base: 5, xs: 'md', md: 'xl', xl: 50 }}` |
| `Grid.Col` | `offset` | Left margin to create gaps. | `offset={{ base: 0, sm: 2, lg: 4 }}` |
| `Grid.Col` | `order` | Visual order of columns. | `order={{ base: 2, sm: 1, lg: 3 }}` |
| `SimpleGrid` | `cols` | Number of columns per row. | `cols={{ base: 1, sm: 2, lg: 5 }}` |
| `SimpleGrid` | `spacing` | Horizontal spacing between columns. | `spacing={{ base: 10, sm: 'xl' }}` |
| `SimpleGrid` | `verticalSpacing` | Vertical spacing between rows. | `verticalSpacing={{ base: 'md', sm: 'xl' }}` |
| `Flex` | `direction` | Flex direction (`row`, `column`). | `direction={{ base: 'column', sm: 'row' }}` |
| `Flex` | `gap` | Spacing between flex items. | `gap={{ base: 'sm', sm: 'lg' }}` |
| `Flex` | `justify` | Alignment along main axis. | `justify={{ sm: 'center' }}` |
| `Flex` | `align` | Alignment along cross axis. | `align={{ md: 'flex-end' }}` |
| `Flex` | `wrap` | Flex wrapping behavior. | `wrap={{ base: 'wrap', lg: 'nowrap' }}` |

### D. Icon Integration: Best Practices for Visual Elements

Mantine offers flexibility in integrating various icon libraries. `Tabler Icons` are highly recommended, as they are consistently used throughout Mantine's own documentation and demos, and some `@mantine/` packages directly depend on them.[43, 44] Other popular and compatible options include `Feather Icons`, `Radix Icons`, `react-icons`, and `Font Awesome`.[43, 44]

When it comes to sizing and coloring icons, most icon libraries compatible with Mantine support a `size` prop (or similar `width`/`height` props), typically accepting values in pixels.[43, 44] However, using `rem` units for the `size` prop is generally discouraged, as it may lead to browser warnings due to SVG standard prohibitions.[43, 44] For custom SVG icons, it is a best practice to use `currentColor` for the `fill` and `stroke` props. This enables the icon's color to automatically inherit from the surrounding text color, ensuring seamless visual consistency with the application's typography.[43, 44] Custom icons should be implemented as React components to leverage this dynamic styling capability effectively.[43, 44]

The importance of providing an `aria-label` for icon-only interactive components is a recurring theme in accessibility discussions. This emphasizes that icons, while visually appealing and useful for conveying information quickly, should not be the *sole* means of communication, especially for interactive elements. This directly applies to web content accessibility guidelines related to "Text Alternatives" and "Sensory Characteristics." The recommendation to use `currentColor` for icon styling also contributes to visual consistency and can indirectly support color contrast, as the icon's color will automatically align with the surrounding text's color scheme. Therefore, icons should primarily *enhance* understanding and visual appeal. For interactive elements or when conveying critical information, always provide a text alternative (e.g., an `aria-label` for an `ActionIcon`, or visible text for a `Button`) and ensure sufficient color contrast. Leveraging `currentColor` ensures seamless integration with the application's color scheme.

## IV. Accessibility Best Practices: Ensuring Inclusive User Experiences

Accessibility is not an optional feature but a fundamental requirement for inclusive design. Mantine is built with accessibility in mind, but developers play a crucial role in ensuring the final application is fully accessible.

### A. Mantine's Built-in Accessibility Features

Mantine components are meticulously designed to adhere to WAI-ARIA accessibility guidelines.[45, 46, 47] This commitment is evident in several key areas:

  * **Proper Roles, `aria-*` Attributes, and Semantics:** Mantine components leverage the correct HTML elements and attributes for their intended purpose, such as using `<button>` for buttons and `<a>` for links.[45, 47, 48, 49, 50] This semantic correctness is fundamental for assistive technologies to interpret content accurately.
  * **Full Keyboard Support:** All interactive components within Mantine are designed to be fully navigable and operable using only a keyboard.[2, 45, 49, 50] This ensures that users who cannot use a mouse can still interact with the application effectively.
  * **Correct Focus Management:** Mantine implements robust focus management, frequently utilizing the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class. This ensures that focus rings are displayed only when a user navigates with a keyboard, providing essential visual feedback without being intrusive for mouse users.[1, 2, 4, 45, 51]
  * **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Mantine components undergo rigorous testing with various screen readers, such as VoiceOver, to ensure full compatibility and accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies.[45] Automated testing with tools like `axe` (jest-axe) is also employed to verify compliance with required roles and `aria-*` attributes.[45]

While Mantine components are designed to follow WAI-ARIA guidelines and are tested with tools like `axe` and screen readers [45, 46, 47], it is important to recognize that Mantine provides an excellent accessibility foundation, but it is not a complete solution on its own. The documentation explicitly asks, "Is there anything I need to do on my side to make my app accessible?" and provides a clear affirmative answer.[45] This highlights a crucial point: while Mantine significantly reduces the burden of building accessible user interfaces, developers must still actively adhere to best practices in their implementation. It is a shared responsibility between the library and the developer to ensure the final application is fully accessible. Therefore, Mantine components provide a solid starting point, but developers must actively apply accessibility best practices, such as proper labeling, ensuring sufficient color contrast, using semantic HTML, and verifying keyboard navigation, to ensure the *entire* application meets web content accessibility standards.

### B. Common Accessibility Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

#### 1\. Providing `aria-label` for Icon-Only Interactive Components

A common oversight in web development involves the use of interactive components that rely solely on icons, such as Mantine's `ActionIcon`, without providing a textual alternative.[48] The issue arises because screen readers will announce these components as a generic "button" or "image" without conveying their specific purpose. This lack of context can significantly hinder the experience for users who rely on assistive technologies.

To address this, developers must always provide a descriptive `aria-label` prop for icon-only interactive components.[47, 48] This attribute's value is read aloud by screen readers, clearly describing the component's function and ensuring that all users understand its purpose. For example, an `ActionIcon` displaying a gear icon should include `aria-label="Settings"` to explicitly communicate its functionality.[48]

#### 2\. Ensuring Sufficient Color Contrast (WCAG Guidelines)

Another frequent mistake involves creating color combinations that result in insufficient contrast between text or icons and their background.[48] This issue is particularly prevalent when using custom colors or certain Mantine variants like `subtle` or `light`. Poor color contrast can make content difficult to read for users with low vision, color blindness, or even in challenging lighting conditions.

To mitigate this, developers should regularly use color contrast checker tools, such as the WebAIM Contrast Checker, to verify that all color combinations meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards (aiming for a minimum of AA conformance, ideally AAA).[47, 48, 50, 52] Mantine's `primaryShade` and `colors` object can be leveraged to define accessible palettes.[48] Furthermore, it is crucial to avoid relying solely on color to convey information, as colorblind users may not perceive the distinction.[47, 50] For instance, an error state should include a textual message or an icon in addition to a red border.

Mantine provides a rich color palette and the `primaryShade` property, along with `autoContrast` functionality, to assist with color management. However, the consistent identification of "Insufficient Color Contrast" as a common developer mistake, especially with custom colors or specific variants, indicates that while Mantine offers valuable tools, developers must actively validate their color choices against WCAG guidelines. This serves as a reminder that automated tools and default settings are merely a starting point, and manual verification is often necessary for nuanced design decisions. Therefore, while Mantine aids in color management, developers are ultimately responsible for ensuring all color combinations, particularly custom ones, meet WCAG contrast ratios. This aligns with the "Perceivable" principle, specifically Guideline 1.4 on Contrast. It is also important to remember that color should not be the *only* indicator of information.

### C. General Accessibility Principles in a Mantine Application

Beyond specific component usage, several overarching accessibility principles must be consistently applied throughout a Mantine application to ensure an inclusive user experience.

**Semantic HTML Usage:** It is crucial to consistently use the correct HTML elements for their intended semantic purpose.[45, 47, 49, 50, 52] This means employing `<button>` for interactive buttons, `<a>` for navigation links, `<nav>` for navigation sections, and `<main>` for the primary content of a page. Mantine components often facilitate this by being polymorphic, allowing developers to specify the underlying HTML element through the `component` prop (e.g., configuring a `Button` component to render as an `<a>` tag when it acts as a link).[20] This semantic correctness is vital for assistive technologies to accurately interpret the structure and functionality of the web page.

**Proper Labeling for Inputs and Interactive Elements:** All form inputs must have clear, associated `labels`.[30, 31, 47] Relying solely on `placeholders` is insufficient for accessibility, as placeholders are often low-contrast, disappear upon user input, and are not discernible by screen readers.[47] Similarly, buttons and links should feature descriptive text that clearly communicates their intended action, providing context for all users.[47]

**Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management:** The entire application must be navigable and operable using only a keyboard.[45, 47, 49, 50, 52] This requires that focus indicators are always visible, a feature enhanced by Mantine's use of `:focus-visible`.[1, 2, 51] Furthermore, the keyboard tab order must be logical and predictable, allowing users to move through interactive elements in an intuitive sequence.[37]

**Descriptive Text and Alt Tags:** For all images that convey information, meaningful `alt` text must be provided.[47, 50] This `alt` text serves as a textual alternative for screen readers, describing the image's content or function. For purely decorative images that do not convey information, the `alt` attribute should be set to an empty string (`alt=""`); this instructs screen readers to skip them, preventing unnecessary verbosity.[47]

The recurring themes across various discussions underscore that accessibility is a shared responsibility, extending beyond the capabilities of a component library alone. It necessitates proactive decisions throughout the development lifecycle, encompassing semantic HTML, clear labeling, logical tab order, sufficient color contrast, and comprehensive text alternatives. These are not one-off tasks but continuous considerations. Integrating accessibility testing tools, such as `axe`, into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a practical implication of this approach. Therefore, accessibility should be treated as an integral part of the development process, not an afterthought. Developers must understand and consistently apply web content accessibility principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust), leveraging Mantine's strengths while actively mitigating common pitfalls through careful implementation and rigorous testing.

## Conclusion

This style guide has systematically outlined how Mantine's robust theming capabilities and comprehensive component library enable the creation of a powerful and consistent design system. By centralizing design tokens within the theme object, standardizing component usage through shared properties and defined variants, and diligently adhering to responsive design and accessibility best practices, development teams can efficiently build high-quality applications that offer a superior user experience.

The core strength of Mantine lies in its ability to provide a strong foundation for both visual consistency and accessibility. The centralized theme object simplifies global design changes, ensuring that updates to colors, typography, or spacing propagate seamlessly across the application. The emphasis on `em` units for breakpoints and the introduction of container queries for components like `Grid` and `SimpleGrid` highlight Mantine's commitment to adaptable and reusable UI elements. However, the analysis also consistently demonstrates that while Mantine provides excellent tools and built-in accessibility features, the ultimate responsibility for an inclusive user experience rests with the developers. Careful attention to semantic HTML, proper labeling, logical keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast remains paramount.

A style guide is a living document, not a static artifact. To maintain its effectiveness and relevance, it must be regularly reviewed and updated. This includes incorporating changes in design language, integrating new features or best practices from Mantine, and adapting to evolving web content accessibility standards. Continuous integration of feedback from designers, developers, and end-users will ensure its ongoing value and contribute to the sustained success and usability of the application.
